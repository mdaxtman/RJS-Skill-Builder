# RJS-Skill-Builder

TEAM GOAL
In refining our direction/mission/taglines, let's keep scalability in mind. How can we build something attractive to other

MISSION
We're a community of students and professionals, each investing into ourselves and others. We're each here to grow, help 
others and find help. Our goal is to provide novice developers with a 'map' to help navigate the ordeal of learning 
professional JavaScript programming. The cycle from novice to professional to master is perpetual, but each lap around the 
track brings accomplishment. Though specific skills in javascript are ever morphing there are abstract skills that persist. 
This is how we have fun in growing: by learning and doing, as a team. Join us!
